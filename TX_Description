Transmitter

	The smart glove is the primary part of the project as it is the part the user will be in contact with.  It consists a 433MHz transmitter, an accelerometer and a bluetooth transmitter all controlled by a arduino nano.  This portion of the project accomplished 3 tasks: counting dumbbell curl repetitions, relaying that count to the phone, and relaying it to the LCD.

	While building this there were a few issues that needed to be dealt with.  To get the accelerometer to count reps an if loop was used to check if there was a significant increase in acceleration to detect if thereâ€™s movement and to check if there were any other recent increases in acceleration to see if it is a seperate movement.  For the 433MHz the range was not quite what we hoped for and using an antenna or increasing power through a transistor did not yield any noticeable improvement.  To solve that a better transmitter/receiver would be used in an  actual product.

	The overall problem this was trying to solve which was helping a person keep track of reps, time, and total volume lifted. This transmitter did what it needed to in order to solve that problem. In the future this could be adapted to other exercises to make this more viable as a product.
